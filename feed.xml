        <content type="html" xml:base="/site/2020/05/23/Black-Swans-review/">&lt;p&gt;I stumbled upon “Black Swans” as I browsed through non-fiction section of Audible audiobooks, looking for something that could help me make sense of the economy and investing. It seemed as though the author meant it to be more than a book about the stock market however, more something of a reflection on the tools we have to predict and prepare for the future. 
Although Nicholas Nassim Taleb starts of by introducing valuable ideas about the nature of uncertainty and our relationship with it, the chapters quickly degenerate into endless ramblings about the incompetence of economists and statisticians, and what was passing for elaborate skeptic thinking quickly turns out to be a simple grudge against academics and practitioners of social sciences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;black-swans--a-summary&quot;&gt;Black swans : a summary&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The author coins the concept of Black Swans, rare events that have a disproportionate impact on our lives and the world around us. They can occur in many domains and have either negative or positive effects. The essence of black swans according to Taleb is that they catch us off-guard. They can impact us negatively, like in the case of war or a market crash, or we could be eagerly awaiting one such exceptional event, like a scientific or technological breakthrough, success for an artist or an innovative business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They are therefore of an unpredictable nature. Much has been done in the way of making predictions in various domains but these are most useful in “Mediocristan”, the realm where uncertainty can be modeled using the Gaussian distribution, which will assume observations of a random variable will cluster around the mean, or other tame distributions. The author mentions that things such as the distribution of people’s height, weight, or the outcome of games of chance; dice, slot machines,… all belong to Medicristan. “Extremistan” on the other hand is where complex and unpredictable social, economic or political events unfold. Taleb argues that winner-takes-all mechanics favor the emergence of events with large impact, and the apparition of a “fat-tail”, where observations far from the mean are more common. One could model book sales in such a way, because a few successful books will tend to be more successful than all of the other books combined. This sort of randomness, along with the complexity of the world and the fact that many phenomena are interrelated, conspire to create events that are unpredictable. Technology is deemed to increase inter-dependence in the world and make it better at predict normal events but more vulnerable to black swans as consequences of small variations are more far-reaching and unexpected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We easily fall for the “Narrative Fallacy”, blame our failures on unpredictable events and explain our successes by our skill, which can be somewhat exaggerated, many of our lives being subjected to untamed uncertainty. History produces many unique events, and our knowledge of the past is simply too sparse to completely understand it, and make accurate predictions from it. This also highlights too the problem of correlation not imply causation. Causation sometimes is not reexamined after it has been inferred from past events, a scientific approach and the use of falsifiable statements in historical theories is needed in order to keep history honest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-unbridled-skeptic&quot;&gt;The unbridled skeptic&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NNT portrays much of the academic world as “suckers” that fall for the trap of thinking they are living in Mediocristan. The truth is, in the face of enormous uncertainty, forecasters are often asked to produce a prediction, which is nothing better than the mean of all the eventualities considered by a model, and can literally extrapolate as far as we want into the future based on simplistic assumptions. Even the most sophisticated models can be absolutely useless if not used properly, knowing their limitations and understanding their assumptions. Their application in business, or even academia, can be clumsy or inappropriate. The antidote is however more erudition and better knowledge of the models used, not moving away from formal studies, so that one can be critical of the tools they are using. The supposedly technical chapter is little more than a diss of the statistics and economics establishment, where one would hope for a dive into the techniques used to cope with uncertainty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout the book, the author takes a skeptic stance, and I agree with the point that people exit doubt too easily and fall prey to dogmatism even in scientific fields, but it seems to me as though the book falls into the trap of discounting all predicting and planning. We can make plans and give predictions that we all know will be inaccurate, or plain wrong, in many human endeavors we cannot rely on our forecasts and the key is to be adaptable and understanding that the assumptions made are just as important as the prediction itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-failings-of-platonicity&quot;&gt;The failings of platonicity&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to make predictions, we have to use well-defined forms and formal systems and we reduce the world and its mechanics to symbols we can manipulate. This consists of all the modelling we do today, and randomness is reduced to a distribution, which is a description of how events happen over time. This is best illustrated by the uniform distribution of the outcome of dice, the distribution of that event telling us that the probability of each number being rolled is $\frac{1}{6}$. In the real world however, uncertainty appears where we don’t even model it, in a fortuitous manner. NNT boasts endlessly of being able to deal with these, but in my opinion the book fails to really address this point, offers little in the way of solutions, much is said about Fractal distributions, which falls under the umbrella of the platonic models so criticized, though they arguably work better in some cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nicholas Nassim Taleb seems to be extremely polarized when it comes to the choices made to model uncertainty, really too much for a skeptic. With bold statements such as “the Nobel prize for economy should be cancelled” and a taste for provocation, Nicholas Nassim Taleb seems desperate to become the black sheep of the world of statistics and economics.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

        <updated>2019-10-28T18:00:00+00:00</updated>
        <id>/site/2019/10/28/Godel-incompleteness</id>
        <content type="html" xml:base="/site/2019/10/28/Godel-incompleteness/">&lt;p&gt;For millenia, people have needed a way to discover truth and knowledge about the world. Aristotle gathered his thoughts on the 
matter in a series of works named &lt;em&gt;The Organon&lt;/em&gt;. The title translates as “The Instrument” and 
conveys a sentiment of accuracy and reliability a subject that was previously much less formal and
even sometimes twisted by &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophist&quot;&gt;the sophists&lt;/a&gt; 
who were eloquent speakers but did not care whether they arrived at the best answer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since then logic has played a central part in the development of Science and Mathematics, and is still used
informally in everyday life to decide what is right or wrong. Logic has become pretty much universal, 
in Sciences few could argue against the simple efficacy of a logical argument.
Over time, logic grew in complexity and power. It is now a well-researched branch of mathematics and 
is also at the heart of the construction of mathematical arguments, both a means and an end.
Mathematics and logic surround us and are seen as this higher authority, though few explore the
foundations on which our knowledge is built.
Aristotle used the word “Instrument”, but these days with the rise in popularity of artificial intelligence it seems
more fitting to talk about logic as a mechanism. Let’s go ahead and see where drawing this parallel between
machines and reason takes us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;the-proof&quot;&gt;The proof&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the core of logic is the formal proof. It is a sequence of sentences in formal language. The
formal language is simply the language in which a sentence can be expressed.&lt;br /&gt;
A sentence is written as&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex; mode=display&quot;&gt;A&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A formula’s Truth value depends on a variable and they are written as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex; mode=display&quot;&gt;A(x)&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to determine whether the proof is valid or not, we will resort to &lt;b&gt;axioms&lt;/b&gt; (sentences that are always
true) and &lt;b&gt;inference rules&lt;/b&gt; (a mechanism through which a sentence can be deducted from one or more
preliminary sentence(s) known as premise(s)). We will refer to a combination of a formal language,
a set of axioms and inference rules as a &lt;b&gt;formal system&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is what a formal proof might look like in natural language :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;em&gt;All humans are made of atoms&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reggie is a human&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reggie is made of atoms&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this example we have taken “All beings are made of atoms” and “Reggie is a being” as axioms of
our system, and the inference rule we used is simply the fact that if a property is true for all
members of a class, then it must be true for a particular member.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And there we have our first proof. The point here is not to argue about the truth of the axioms but more so to determine whether
a proof is valid or not. This is of course not a purely mechanical proof. A complete specification
of axioms and inference rules as well as the language would take several pages, not to mention
building a mechanism to verify it! Even in papers, a common knowledge of the formal system is
assumed for brevity’s sake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-very-brief-history-of-formal-systems&quot;&gt;A very brief history of Formal Systems&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the end of the 19th century to the middle of the 20th century, many mathematicians worked on
formalizing Set Theory. The effort could be said to have started with Georg Cantor, credited with the invention of
Set Theory, and includes work by mathematicians including Gottlob Frege, Bertrand Russell as well as Ernst Zermelo and Abraham Fraenkel who gave
their name to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zermelo%E2%80%93Fraenkel_set_theors&quot;&gt;ZF(C)&lt;/a&gt; (Zermelo-Frankel set theory) which is still in use today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure style=&quot;float:right&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgflip.com/3fd7us.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Hilbert's strong belief in Completeness&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;Hilbert's strong belief in Completeness&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When in the year 1900 the mathematician David Hilbert published a list of 23 problems &lt;a class=&quot;citation&quot; href=&quot;#hilp&quot;&gt;(Hilbert, 1900)&lt;/a&gt;, the
notion was that with a suitable formal system, all of the statements in mathematics could either be
proved right or wrong. This is what we call &lt;b&gt;completeness&lt;/b&gt;. 
In fact, Hilbert’s 10th problem asks for
a construction of the solution for a specific class of equations, the Diophantine equations,
assuming that there had to be such an algorithm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In his second problem, he also asks for a proof of
the &lt;b&gt;consistency&lt;/b&gt; of the axioms of arithmetic, meaning whether it would be impossible to prove
a sentence in arithmetic and its opposite. The promise of finally filling the gaps in mathematics
seem to have appealed to young Kurt Gödel and he started his PhD with the intention of
contributing to Hilbert’s dream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;gödel-numbering-and-representability&quot;&gt;Gödel numbering and representability&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This paragraph contains some mathematical notation necessary to explain how the incompleteness 
theorems came to be. If that’s not your cup of tea, go ahead and skip to the First Incompleteness Theorem section&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides consistency, there is another notion which is central to understanding Set
Theory: representability. A weakly representable set has a corresponding formula. A given integer is
in the set if and only if we can prove the formula to be true for that integer. This essentially
implies that there is a method to enumerate all elements of the set, but we might not necessarily be
able to prove that an element is not in the set.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To enable talking about logic within the language we introduce Gödel numbering, the association of
any formula of the formal language with a natural number. This is today quite intuitive as anything
we represent in a computer is in binary code. Let us not explain exactly how this is done and assume
that there is such a mapping. More interestingly, proofs are also represented as numbers…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will define the code of a formula $A$ as $\ulcorner A \urcorner$. All the rules of logic can then 
be transposed as functions of the Gödel numbers, even the inference rules.
One key consequence of this is that we can decide whether a sequence of statements is a valid proof 
using arithmetic!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With that knowledge, let us go back to Set Theory.
The question of whether a number is in a set could be answered by proving that a specific formula is
true for $x$.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex; mode=display&quot;&gt;x \in S_A \iff F \vdash A(x) &lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here we have introduced several notations: $F$ is the formal system that we’re working with, and
$A(x)$ is a formula that has a value of True or False for every integer, and corresponds to the set $S_A$.
Here, $F \vdash A(x)$ indicates that it is possible to prove that $A(x)$ is True with the axioms and
inference rules of $F$.
The $\iff$ symbol indicates the provability of $A(x)$ for all elements of the set $S_a$. This
property is known as weak representability and is very important for what follows, as it establishes
a bridge between Set Theory and the formal system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can now use formulas as arguments of other formulas thanks to Gödel numbering.
We could for example define the set of all provable sentences, and find a nice formula that can only
be proved to be true for the Gödel number of provable statements (formulas). We define 
provability as a formula of the language!&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex; mode=display&quot;&gt;F \vdash A \implies F \vdash Prov_F(\ulcorner A \urcorner)&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;the-diagonalization-lemma&quot;&gt;The Diagonalization Lemma&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Gödel numbering, we can now write equivalent formulas, but using numbers as representations of
formulas!
We can use that strange loop in mathematics to find a formula’s special “fixed point” sentence. The
diagonalization lemma tells us that for any formula $A$ we can construct a sentence $D$ such that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex; mode=display&quot;&gt;F \vdash D \iff A(\ulcorner D \urcorner)&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That sentence’s provability is inextricably linked to $A$’s true value. If $D$ is provable, then
$A(\ulcorner D \urcorner)$ is true, and if it is false then $D$ is not provable. 
Applying this to the negation of the provability sentence described earlier yields the first
of Gödel’s incompleteness theorems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;gödels-first-incompleteness-theorem&quot;&gt;Gödel’s First Incompleteness Theorem&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Assuming $F$ is a formal system with sufficient arithmetic&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; then we can construct a sentence $G_F$
of the language of $F$ such that $G_F$ is true but not provable. 
In other terms, we have a sentence $G_F$ that says the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;em&gt;This sentence is not provable &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We could try to prove this sentence. But if we succeeded that
would mean the sentence would be provable which contradicts its very meaning. The
sentence would then be False and we cannot prove False sentences.
Is it False then? We encounter a similar problem when assuming the sentence is False, since that
would again lead us to proving a False sentence.
Seeing as we assumed that the system was consistent, that sentence is &lt;b&gt;not provable&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;not
False&lt;/b&gt; and therefore it &lt;b&gt;must be True&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;gödels-second-incompleteness-theorem&quot;&gt;Gödel’s Second Incompleteness Theorem&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We &lt;b&gt;have proven&lt;/b&gt; that consistency of the system implies that the Gödel sentence is true but 
unprovable. The second theorem is about consistency and is linked to Hilbert’s second problem. It 
was noted that if a system can prove its consistency, then it must also be able to prove the Gödel
sentence $G_F$.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;$F$ can prove $Consistency(F)$&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Gödel’s first theorem: $Consistency(F)$ implies that $G_F$ is true&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From 1. and 2., we can deduce that if $F$ can prove $Consistency(F)$ then $F$ can prove $G_F$.
By contradiction, we can then conclude that consistency cannot be proven.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;incompleteness-vs-decidability&quot;&gt;Incompleteness vs Decidability&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later in the twentieth century, Alonzo Church and Alan Turing took a similar approach to prove the
undecidability of First Order Logic.&lt;a class=&quot;citation&quot; href=&quot;#hopcroft&quot;&gt;(Hopcroft, Motwani, &amp;amp; Ullman, 2006)&lt;/a&gt; 
A theorem that there is a mechanical way to verify is called recursive. Of course if a theorem cannot be proven, then it can hardly be verified mechanically. 
On the other hand, for a specific set, there might be a way to enumerate elements of the set, 
but there might not be a general, mechanical way to verify (prove) that a particular number belongs 
to the set. One example of such a problem is the &lt;b&gt;Halting Problem&lt;/b&gt;. It is defining the set of
programs that terminate. Of course, it is possible to build an infinity of programs that satisfy
this definition, but for a specific program it is not always possible to know if it will, like
a program that looks for integers that satisfy Fermat’s last theorems.
A system is called decidable if all of its theorems (sentences derivable in it) is decidable. 
Incompleteness of a system implies its undecidability but there are many cases where a system is
complete yet undecidable. Gödel himself showed that there are complete systems in First-Order
Logic, yet First Order Logic is undecidable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;humans-vs-mechanisms&quot;&gt;Humans vs Mechanisms&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some would see these theorems as a fundamental flaw, an acknowledgement by mathematics of its own
shortcomings, though there really is nothing wrong with probing the limits of our tools for 
reasoning. Beyond Gödel’s sentence which might seem a specific edge case that should not be allowed,
there are “reasonable” cases that are not provable and even more that are not computable. So is 
there something missing in our system? Is there any system at all with sufficient arithmetic capable of 
completeness? Based on the discussion we just had, it would seem a mathematician is capable to find 
a sentence to be true where formal systems are not able to prove them. Therefore no formal system can 
be devised that encompasses the mathematician’s knowledge or general human intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though what struck me as I examined the consequences of the GITs, is that we actually used logic to
come to the incompleteness results. Indeed they are just another set of theorems, inferred from our
definitions of provability and notations related to Gödel numbering.
We have found that we cannot always prove the truth, yet on that journey we 
used the very system that we are trying to understand better. The incompleteness theorems are now
just another tennet of mathematics, upon which we can expand and prove more and more theorems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The incompleteness theorems are just stating a system’s limit, assuming the system to be consistent.
Any “logic machine” could verify that proof, and there is no mysterious human factor that sets us
apart from that machine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This mathematical introspection had a major influence in the development of computer
science. In fact formal systems were a central of artificial intelligence research in its early days.
However this approach sometimes labeled as Good Old Fashioned Artificial Intelligence (GOFAI) has 
shown its limits in terms of practicality. In these systems, a gigantic number of axioms and 
definitions is needed to arrive at a conclusion in all but the most basic of practical cases.
In recent years, AI has experienced a resurgence of interest, due to availability of data and
hardware and using non-deductive methods (neural networks, statistical inference). Of course the
decisions we arrive at using these methods aren’t as clean-cut as when using a formal system. And as
we design machines with higher and higher power of abstraction, it is important to remember, neither they
nor us will know everything.&lt;/p&gt;
